# L1-BER

1. Create a model composed of a random data bit source (equal probabilities for bits 0 and 1), a
BPSK modulator, an AWGN-channel and a BPSK demodulator.

2. Using the model you created calculate BER for one chosen Eb/N0 â€“value (e.g. 4) for
several different seeds (at least 5 different seeds in Bernoulli Binary Generator) vs. number
of simulated symbols

3. Analyze receiver delay impacts
